<h1>The problem to be solved</h1>

The problem was proposed by Rossmann  company at Kaggle plataform where the sales managers ordered a prediction about sales in the next six weeks based in historical datas of their stores.


<h1>Business question</h1>

<h3>How can we predict the revenue to the next six weeks for each Rossmann's store?</h3>
<h3>What attributes are important to build a predict model?</h3>
<h3>What the best model predict to use?</h3>


<h1>Featuring engineering</h1>

Feature engineering is the process of to create and transform the most variables frow raw data to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. When we are building a predict model we have to select the best features to use in the model for improve the predict performance. Sometimes, there is not the features needed in the raw data, then the feature engineering is the way to create and select them.
